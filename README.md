Random RP
=========

This is a site meant to be used to find random strangers who would like to play a short RPG session. It is inspired by [the original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/vearv/role_play_with_a_stranger_yes_i_did/) by [aWOLtrooper](http://www.reddit.com/user/aWOLtrooper) on [/r/rpg](http://www.reddit.com/r/rpg).

As of now, it features only very basic functionality, but more is planned for the future.

# To do
(In no particular order)
* Tag filtering/searching
* Publishing finished sessions
* Account management
* Password for rooms
* Private rooms
* Semi-persistent game sessions

#To maybe do
* Rich-text formatting (probably markdown)
* Immersion effects (sounds, background colours...)
* Persistent player characters
